        "\n",
        "Proving a proposition in planar geometry is like an outdoor exploration -- to find a path from the starting point (the problem) to the destination (the conclusion). Yet the path can be a broad highway, or a meandering trail, or -- you may even find yourself in front of a river. \n",
        "\n",
        "The auxiliary lines are the bridges to get you across. Such lines are indispensible in many problems, or can drastically simplify the proof in others. Just like there is no universal rule on where or how to build the bridge for all kind of terrains, the auxiliary lines have to be designed for each individual problem. Difficult as it can be for beginners, the process of analyzing the problem and finding the solution is rigorous, creative, fascinating and extremely rewarding. This booklet is intended to give you a helping hand."

Since $AG, AH, AD$ are three coline segments, no similar triangle is composed of the three line segments. Therefore, we must find a transitional proportion to connect the original proportion and the conclusion. Since $AD$ is the diameter of $\\odot$$AEF$, connect $DE$, $\\triangle$DAB is right triangle.Therefore, $AD^2 = AE^.AB$. To prove $AD^2 = AD^.AH$, we only need to get $AD^. AB=AG^.AH$, i.e. to get $\\frac{AE}{AG}=\\frac{AH}{AB}$, which is straightforward if we could prove $\\triangle AEG \\sim \\triangle AHB$. Since both triangles shared an angle, only need to prove $\\angle AEG = \\angle H$. Since $\\angle H=\\angle C$, only need to prove $\\angle AEG=\\angle C$. And since $\\angle C$ is supplementary of $\\angle CAD$, $\\angle AEG$ is supplementary of $\\angle DEF$, and $\\angle CAD = \\angle DEF$, therefore, the proof is done.\r\n",

        "The claims from problem 22 to problem 26 are all related to proportional line segments. To prove the problem related to proportional line segments, first need to convert the conclusion into proportions. For example, to prove $ab=cd$, first convert $ab=cd$ to $\\frac{a}{c}=\\frac{d}{b}$ or$\\frac{a}{d}=\\frac{c}{b}$; to prove $a^2=bc$, first convert to $\\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{c}{a}$ or $\\frac{a}{c}=\\frac{b}{a}$. In euclidian geometry, to prove a theorem related to proportional line segments, we may start from a theorem related to similar triangles, to find whether the link segments in the proportional are mapped to the corresponding pair of sides in the similar triangles. If such triangles exist in the figure, we may prove they are smiliar triangles If such triangles does not exist, we need to add auxiliary line to connect some end points of the line segments to construct triangles (refer to problem 22), then prove they are similar. If the line segments in the proportional cannot construct corresponding sides of similar triangles, usually we need to select intersect pints to construct auxiliary lines parallel to other line segments, then apply parallem theory to get proportional relationship. (refer to problem 23 and problem 24 proof 1,2,3).\r\n",
