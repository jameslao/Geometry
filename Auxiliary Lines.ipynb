    "# Auxiliary Lines in Planar Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "Proving a proposition in planar geometry is like an outdoor exploration -- to find a path from the starting point (the problem) to the destination (the conclusion). Yet the path can be a broad highway, or a meandering trail, or -- you may even find yourself in front of a river. \n",
    "\n",
    "The auxiliary lines are the bridges to get you across. Such lines are indispensible in many problems, or can drastically simplify the proof in others. Just like there is no universal rule on where or how to build the bridge for all kind of terrains, the auxiliary lines have to be designed for each individual problem. Difficult as it can be for beginners, the process of analyzing the problem and finding the solution is rigorous, creative, fascinating and extremely rewarding. This booklet is intended to give you a helping hand."

    "It's obvious that to prove $BE \\| AC$, we can start from proving $\\angle EBC = \\angle ACB$, or $\\angle BEA = \\angle CAE$. To prove $BE = AC$, we can try to prove $\\triangle BED \\cong \\triangle CAD$. Note that as the corresponding angles are equal in congruent triangles, $\\angle EBC = \\angle ACB$ or $\\angle BEA = \\angle CAE$ will already be implied when the congruency is established, which is all we need. The proof can be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\because$ $AD$ is a median of $\\triangle ABC$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore BD = DC$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\therefore BE = AC, \\angle EBD = \\angle ACD$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\therefore BE \\| AC$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the drawing, we came to the solution fairly smoothly in this example. But in many cases, the drawing itself may not be enough, and auxiliary lines are required. Even in this example, if we connect $CE$, we get $\\text{â–±}ABEC$, from which we can easily prove $BE = AC$ and $BE \\| AC$. \n",

Therefore, we can pick the midpoint $L$ of $AB$ first, then show that $L, M, N$ are collinear.

But the collinearity of $D, N, E$ is still to be proved. From $\\triangle ADN \\cong \\triangle CEN$, we know that $\\angle AND = \\angle CNE$, so it is not too difficult to show that $D, N, E$ are collinear.

The question becomes how to find the point to divide $BC$? Since $G$ and $I$ are the centroid and incenter, based on the property of centroid, draw line $AGM$, so $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a scalene triangle, $BM\\neq\\frac{1}{2}\\,AB$, $CM\\neq\\frac{1}{2}\\,AC$. Draw angle bisector $AI$ and extend it to intersect with  $BC$ at $N$, based on the property of angle bisector, $\\frac{AB}{BN}\\,=\\frac{AC}{NC}\\,$, if the ratio is 2:1, then point $N$ will be the divide point. Connect $CI$, $CI$ is also an angle bisector. In $\\triangle ACN$, $\\frac{AC}{NC}\\,=\\frac{AI}{IN}\\,$.

If the line segments in the proportional cannot construct corresponding sides of similar triangles, usually we need to select intersect pints to construct auxiliary lines parallel to other line segments, then apply parallem theory to get proportional relationship.

    "*Analysis* To prove $\\angle 1=\\angle 2$, from the converse of the angle bisector theorem, we only need to prove $\\frac{PC}{PD}=\\frac{MC}{MD}$. But it is hard to find the relation between $PC, PD$ and other line segments, hence we are trying to match $\\angle 1, \\angle 2$ with other angles. After connecting $OC$ and $OD$, it is not that hard to see that $\\triangle OCD$ is isosceles, with $\\angle 3=\\angle 4$. Also, $\\angle 3, \\angle 4$ and $\\angle 1, \\angle 2$ are all the angles in quadrilateral $PCOD$. if we can prove $P, C, O, D$ are concyclic, we will get $\\angle 1=\\angle 4, \\angle 2=\\angle 3$ and $\\angle 1=\\angle 2$ will follow.\n",

    "To prove $P, C, O, D$ are concyclic, there are no other angle relations can be used. According to the method of adding auxiliary circles in Figure 69, we'll be good if we can prove $MC\\cdot MD=MO\\cdot MP$. Since $MC\\cdot MD=MA\\cdot MB$, we only need to prove $MO\\cdot MP=MA\\cdot MB=MA^2$. Connect radius $OA$, and we have an right $\\triangle PAO$.

    "Example 9 and Example 10 are about proving the equality of two line segments or two angles inside a circle. Since the relation between the conditions and the conclusions are implicit, a direct proof can be hard. If we say the difficulty of Example 7 and Example 8 is to divide a complex problem into several simpler ones, then the trick for Example 9 and 10 is to convert the implicit relations between the conditions and the conclusions into explicit ones. In order to do such complicated conversions, we often resort to \"intermediary\" angles or line segments, for which auxiliary lines are drawn. For example, in Example 9, first we added two auxiliary lines $OM$ and $ON$ to prove $AM=AN$, then two more lines $OC$ and $OD$ to prove $OM=ON$, and finally two auxiliary circles through $O, C, A, M$ and $O, D, N, A$ to prove $\\angle OMC = \\angle OND$.\n",

To prove these 4 points are concyclic, we made the auxiliary radius $OA$ and the right triangle $PAO$.\n",

Since $CD$ is tangent to $\\odot O_2$, it is naturally to think of using the tangent-secant theorem to solve this problem. But there is no a secant in the figure -- we need to make an auxiliary one. Note that if the three points $C, P$, and $B$ are collinear, we will have $CD^2=CP\\cdot CB$. Then as long as we can prove $AC^2=CP\\cdot CB$, the conclusion will follow.\n",

By Example 32 of Basic problems we have $\\angle APB=90^\\circ$. Now we only need to prove $AC^2=CP\\cdot CB$. It is easy to see that from  the projection theorem within the right triangle $\\triangle ACB$.\n",

    "Examples 1 to 10 are resolved by repeatedly applying the analyses, thinking process and ways of adding auxiliary lines in \"Basic problems\", while Examples 11 and 12 are proved by applying conclusions from \"Basic problems\" directly, which can often simplify the proof. So, the thinking process, the ways of adding auxiliary lines or even conclusions in \"Basic problems\" can be the bases of solving advanced problems. But sometimes this can come the other way. For example, Example 14 in \"Basic problems\" states that \"if $P$ is a point in the arc $\\widearc{BC}$ of the circumcircle of an equilateral triangle $ABC$, then $PA=PB+PC$.\" (Figure 99).\n",

    "Since $ABPC$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, and we are to prove the diagonal $PA$ equals to the sum of two sides $PB$ and $PC$, it reminds us of Ptolemy's theorem, i.e. \"For a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of the products of the lengths of the pairs of opposite sides is equal to the product of the lengths of two diagonals\". By applying this theorem directly, we can come to the conclusion without adding any auxiliary line. Divide both sides of equation $PA\\cdot BC=PC\\cdot AB+PB\\cdot AC$ by the length of the side of the equilateral triangle, we get $PA=PB+PC$ directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we come to the end of adding auxiliary lines. From all above we can see that planar geometry is a rich topic with a vast variety of methods. The thinking processes are intertwined between basic and complex problems, and there's no way to demarcate one from the other. In this pamphlet, we do so only to introduce basic methods before progressing to harder problems, and we hope it can help the readers to master the approaches to convert complex problems into simple ones by adding auxiliary lines."
