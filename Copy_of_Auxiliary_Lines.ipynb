        "Proving a proposition in planar geometry is like an outdoor exploration -- to find a path from the starting point (the problem) to the destination (the conclusion). Yet the path can be a broad highway, or a meandering trail, or -- you may even find yourself in front of a river. \n",
        "\n",
        "The auxiliary lines are the bridges to get you across. Such lines are indispensible in many problems, or can drastically simplify the proof in others. Just like there is no universal rule on where or how to build the bridge for all kind of terrains, the auxiliary lines have to be designed for each individual problem. Difficult as it can be for beginners, the process of analyzing the problem and finding the solution is rigorous, creative, fascinating and extremely rewarding. This booklet is intended to give you a helping hand."

To get $\\frac{a}{b}$,$\\frac{b}{c}$, $\\frac{c}{a}$, need to find a line segment that is relavent to $\\frac {AX}{XB}$, $\\frac{BY}{YC}$, $\\frac{CZ}{ZA}$. As shown in Figure 62, if connect $BZ$, create parallel lines of $BZ$ passing A and passing C, intersecting $XY$ and its extension line at $M,N$, then $MY$ is the desired line segment. Therefore, we have $\\frac {AX}{XB} = \\frac{AM}{BZ}$, $\\frac{BY}{YC} = \\frac{BZ}{CN}$, $\\frac{CZ}{ZA} = \\frac{CN}{AM}$, a multiplication of the three equations get $\\frac {AX}{XB} \\frac{BY}{YC} \\frac{CZ}{ZA}$ = $\\frac {AM}{BZ} \\frac{BZ}{CN} \\frac{CN}{AM}$ = 1. Similarly, connect $CX$(or $AY$), create $AM$,$BN$ parallel to $CX$, intersecting $XY$ and its extension at $M$,$N$ could get the same result.\r\n",

        "The claims from problem 22 to problem 26 are all related to proportional line segments. To prove the problem related to proportional line segments, first need to convert the conclusion into proportions.

In euclidian geometry, to prove a theorem related to proportional line segments, we may start from a theorem related to similar triangles, to find whether the link segments in the proportional are mapped to the corresponding pair of sides in the similar triangles. If such triangles exist in the figure, we may prove they are smiliar triangles If such triangles does not exist, we need to add auxiliary line to connect some end points of the line segments to construct triangles (refer to problem 22), then prove they are similar. If the line segments in the proportional cannot construct corresponding sides of similar triangles, usually we need to select intersect pints to construct auxiliary lines parallel to other line segments, then apply parallem theory to get proportional relationship.

If we say the difficulty of Example 7 and Example 8 is to divide a complex problem into several simpler ones, then the trick for Example 9 and 10 is to convert the implicit relations between the conditions and the conclusions into explicit ones. In order to do such complicated conversions, we often resort to \"intermediary\" angles or line segments, for which auxiliary lines are drawn. For example, in Example 9, first we added two auxiliary lines $OM$ and $ON$ to prove $AM=AN$, then two more lines $OC$ and $OD$ to prove $OM=ON$, and finally two auxiliary circles through $O, C, A, M$ and $O, D, N, A$ to prove $\\angle OMC = \\angle OND$.\n",
